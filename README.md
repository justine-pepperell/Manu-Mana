## Manu Mana APP (MVP)

This repository contains the code files for the MVP of a bird tacking application that takes a Te Reo Māori language first approach to biodiversity reporting by communities within Aotearoa.  The app also shares stories about the cultural and spiritual significance of Aotearoa’s native birds with reference to Māori culture. The team acknowledges that bird names and meanings vary within iwi groups across Aotearoa. Biodiversity reporting with a Te Reo Māori first approach requires careful consideration in any future iterations of the Manu Mana APP.  While learning more about the use of Te Reo Māori in biodiversity reporting, the team learned about key academic research in this area, please scroll down to view links to related research.
