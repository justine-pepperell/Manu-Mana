        <h1>Kaitiakitanga</h1>
        <p>
            Maori believe in and recognise the deep kinship between humans and the natural world. This connection is expressed through kaitiakitanga - a way of managing the environment.

        <h2>Kaupapa/Purpose</h2>
        <p>Manu Mana is more than a web application: the project is about design, protecting taonga, relationships, and learning in a digital age. It is also an exploration of what it means to be an ethical technologist working in bicultural Aotearoa.</p>

        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>Māori language and cultural stories are toanga that should be treated with care and consideration. Furthermore, Māori Data Sovereignty, must be considered in Aotearoa: “New Zealand is one of the few countries in the world that has adopted a whole-of-government approach to safeguarding Māori cultural heritage. In 2020, the Waitangi Tribunal - a permanent inquiry into the treatment of the Maori people - advised data should be included in this heritage.” Source: <a href='https://techmonitor.ai/policy/privacy-and-data-protection/maori-data-sovereignty-new-zealand-indigenous'>Māori data sovereignty</a></p>
