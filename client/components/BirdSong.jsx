        <p>Research shows that listening to melodic birdsong can help people recover from stress and cognitive fatigue.</p>
        <p>So, find a quiet place, close your eyes and listen to a recording of tūī and a chorus of many other birds singing in mixed bush and flowering kōwhai in magical Aotearoa.</p>
